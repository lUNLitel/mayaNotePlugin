# Maya Note Plugin

The Maya Note Plugin allows users to embed text notes directly into Maya scene files, providing a fast and seamless way to annotate your work. Notes are saved within the scene, making them easy to reference and share with collaborators.

## Features

* Embed notes directly into Maya files
* Quickly annotate scenes without external documents
* Automatically saves notes within the scene
* Accessible via a dedicated **Note** menu

## Installation

1. Download the Python plugin file.
2. Drag the `.py` file directly into the Maya viewport.
3. Maya will automatically install and load the plugin.

## How to Use

1. After installation, look for a **Note** menu in Maya's main menu bar.
2. If the menu does not appear:

   * Go to **Windows → Settings/Preferences → Plug-in Manager**
   * Find your plugin in the list
   * Enable **Loaded** and **Auto Load**
3. Once loaded, use the Note menu to create, edit, or view embedded notes.

## Troubleshooting

* **Note menu not showing:** Ensure the plugin is loaded in the Plug-in Manager.
* **Notes not saving:** Verify you are saving the Maya scene after editing notes.

## Compatibility

* Only tested in Maya 2023, should work across all Maya versions after 2020
